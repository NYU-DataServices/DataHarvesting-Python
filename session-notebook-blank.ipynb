    " - Obtain data and load it into a suitable data \"container\" for analysis, often via a web interface, especially an API\n",
    " - Parse the data retrieved via an API and turn it into a useful object for manipulation and analysis\n",

    "It is not unusual to find open data served directly on the web, without requiring any tokens or authorizations. Although it is not often the practice to provide very large resources via such an entrypoint because of the burden it places on data servers, smaller datasets are frequently available. When it comes to such non-API generated data it is generally easier to work with services that serve the data directly in its native file format, rather than wrapping it in HTML. The latter requires you to parse first the HTML or interpret the HTTP response.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, take the motor vehicle accident report <a href=\"https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/Motor-Vehicle-Crashes-Vehicle-Information-Three-Ye/xe9x-a24f\">data found here</a>. One thousand records from this 1.65 million-record dataset can be accessed directly at <a href=\"https://data.ny.gov/resource/xe9x-a24f.json\">https://data.ny.gov/resource/xe9x-a24f.json</a> (FYI Firefox has a nice JSON viewer built in when you encounter .json hosted files on the web.)\n",

    "Let's walk through making an HTTP request for that .json data and quickly transforming it into a useful container (a Pandas dataframe) to ready it for use. We'll make use of Python's <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html\">JSON module</a>, a compact and easy-to-use way of turning JSON into Python's native object types, lists and dictionaries. If you want to anticipate what JSON input will prompt which Python object type output, see this table here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#json-to-py-table.

    "In our example above, using sodapy, notice that we can set the number of results we obtain for each request. This is helpful, even if we want the full set of data. At 1.6 million records, this dataset is taxing (though not extraordinarly so) on our http connection to grab it in one go.\n",

    "Take, for example, the city of New York's 311 calls data (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9). At over 22.4 million records, it isn't realistic to pull the entire dataset in one go. You must page results by passing a \"limit\" and \"offset\" paramters in your request URL. Think of this as the total number of records (limit) and a way to request subsequent subsets of results (first page, second page, third page; or offset 0, 1, 2...). An example is available here: [https://dev.socrata.com/docs/paging.html](https://dev.socrata.com/docs/paging.html)."
