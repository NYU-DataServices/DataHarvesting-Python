## Overview

This session is an intermediate-to-advanced level class that offers some ideas for how to approach the following common data wrangling needs in research:

 - Obtain data and load it into a suitable data "container" for analysis, often via a web interface, especially an API
 - Parse the data retrieved via an API and turn it into a useful object for manipulation and analysis
 - Perform some basic data integrity checks to ensure data found "in the wild" on the web is ready for analysis

## Setup

**Project Environment**

Download the notebook available at [https://goo.gl/Pnm7Dx](https://goo.gl/Pnm7Dx) and open it in Jupyter Notebook.
